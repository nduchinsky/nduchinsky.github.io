        <h2>My Scouting Expierence</h2>
        <h3>Eagle Scout Rank Achieved in June of 2021</h3>
<hr>
       <p>One of my hobbies is spending time outdoors or just doing something productive outdoors. 
        Ever since I joined Cub Scouts in the 1st grade until I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in June of 2021 
        I always have always been drawn to the outdoors. In the summer of 2021 (right after my high school graduation) 
        I had the oppurunity to go on a backpacking trip to a high adventure camp in New Mexico called Philmont. 
        It was a 2 week journey in the backcountry on New Mexico. At the end we hiked over 120 miles in 2 weeks and ranged in elevation from  
        6,500 to 12,441 feet.
